/* SIMD (SSE1+MMX or SSE2) implementation of cephes math library

   Inspired by Intel Approximate Math library, and based on the
   corresponding algorithms of the cephes math library

   The default is to use the SSE1 version. If you define USE_SSE2 the
   the SSE2 intrinsics will be used in place of the MMX intrinsics. Do
   not expect any significant performance improvement with SSE2.
   
   This is an improved version from Julien Pommier.
